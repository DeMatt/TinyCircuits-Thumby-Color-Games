Bounce Demo provides a fun demonstration of the PhysicsCircle2DNode class.

Features:
- Up to 16 bouncing bubbles simultaneously.  Random color, initial position, and initial velocity.
- Idle counter, showing how many milliseconds of idle time is available per frame (60 FPS = maximum 16 2/3 milliseconds per frame). Note that the counter bottoms out at zero!
- Adjustable gravity.
- Bounce beeps!  Or not.

Controls:
- A:  add a bubble (maximum of 16).
- B:  delete the oldest bubble.
- D-pad:  increase gravity in the specified direction (numbers in upper right).
- Right Bumper:  reset gravity to zero.
- Left Bumper:  cycle audio mode (icon in upper left):
    - No audio:  no audio.
    - Low audio:  bubbles beep when they bump each other.
    - High audio:  bubbles beep when they bump anything.
- Menu:  exit.
