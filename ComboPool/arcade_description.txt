This is a recreation of Combo Pool by NuSan on Pico 8. You shoot balls and when two of the same ball collide they combine into the next color. The objective is to create two black balls and get them to collide and you win. The colors go from white > yellow > orange > red > purple > blue > black. Each time you shoot a ball your health goes down and each time two balls combine into one your health goes up. If you run out of health and all the balls stop moving then you lose the game. Bumpers aim left and right, A shoots and B slows down the aim for more accurate shots.
